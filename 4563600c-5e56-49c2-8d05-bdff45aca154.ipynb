    "The dataset contains various attributes of diamonds, such as their shape, cut, color, clarity, carat weight, dimensions, price, and other characteristics. For management research, you can explore correlations that go beyond simple relationships like \"price vs. carat weight.\" Here are some complex and unobvious correlations you can investigate:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Price Optimization Based on Multiple Factors**\n",
    "   - Investigate how **price** is influenced by a combination of factors like **cut, color, clarity, carat weight, and fluorescence**. Use **multivariate regression** or **machine learning models** to identify the most significant predictors of price.\n",
    "   - Example: Does a diamond with a slightly lower clarity but a better cut and fluorescence fetch a higher price?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Impact of Shape on Price and Dimensions**\n",
    "   - Analyze how **shape** affects the relationship between **price** and **dimensions (length, width, height)**. For example, certain shapes (e.g., round vs. pear) may have different pricing trends based on their proportions.\n",
    "   - Example: Does the **length-to-width ratio** have a stronger impact on price for certain shapes like oval or radiant?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Fluorescence and Price Relationship**\n",
    "   - Investigate whether **fluorescence** (e.g., faint, strong) has a significant impact on price, and whether this impact varies across different **types** (e.g., GIA vs. GIA Lab-Grown).\n",
    "   - Example: Does fluorescence negatively affect the price of natural diamonds but positively affect lab-grown diamonds?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Lab-Grown vs. Natural Diamonds**\n",
    "   - Compare the pricing trends and characteristics of **GIA Lab-Grown** diamonds vs. **GIA** diamonds. Investigate whether lab-grown diamonds with higher clarity and color grades are priced similarly to natural diamonds with lower grades.\n",
    "   - Example: Are lab-grown diamonds with \"Ideal\" cut and \"D\" color priced competitively with natural diamonds of similar grades?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Cut Quality and Proportions**\n",
    "   - Explore how **cut quality (e.g., Ideal, Excellent)** interacts with **depth %, table %, and symmetry** to influence price. Certain combinations of these proportions may yield higher prices.\n",
    "   - Example: Does an \"Ideal\" cut with a specific range of depth % and table % result in a premium price?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Clarity vs. Carat Weight Trade-Off**\n",
    "   - Investigate whether customers prioritize **clarity** or **carat weight** when choosing diamonds. For example, are diamonds with higher carat weights but lower clarity grades priced similarly to smaller diamonds with higher clarity?\n",
    "   - Example: Is there a threshold where carat weight becomes more important than clarity for pricing?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Length-to-Width Ratio and Shape Preferences**\n",
    "   - Analyze how the **length-to-width ratio** varies across different shapes and whether it correlates with price. Certain shapes (e.g., pear, oval) may have an optimal ratio that maximizes price.\n",
    "   - Example: Does a higher length-to-width ratio in pear-shaped diamonds result in a higher price?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **Market Segmentation by Price**\n",
    "   - Segment the diamonds into price tiers (e.g., low, mid, high) and analyze how attributes like **cut, color, clarity, and fluorescence** differ across these segments. This can help identify which attributes are most valued in each price tier.\n",
    "   - Example: Are \"Excellent\" cut diamonds more common in the high-price segment, while \"Very Good\" cuts dominate the mid-price segment?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. **Girdle Thickness and Price**\n",
    "   - Investigate whether **girdle thickness** (e.g., medium, thick) has a significant impact on price, and whether this varies by shape or cut quality.\n",
    "   - Example: Does a \"Medium to Thick\" girdle result in a higher price for round diamonds but not for cushion-shaped diamonds?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. **Symmetry and Polish Interaction**\n",
    "   - Explore the interaction between **symmetry** and **polish** and their combined effect on price. For example, does having both \"Excellent\" symmetry and polish result in a disproportionately higher price compared to having just one of these attributes rated as \"Excellent\"?\n",
    "   - Example: Is the price premium for \"Excellent\" polish higher for diamonds with \"Very Good\" symmetry compared to those with \"Good\" symmetry?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. **Type and Price Elasticity**\n",
    "   - Investigate the **price elasticity** of diamonds based on their **type** (e.g., GIA vs. GIA Lab-Grown). Determine whether lab-grown diamonds are more sensitive to price changes compared to natural diamonds.\n",
    "   - Example: Are customers more willing to pay a premium for natural diamonds with higher clarity compared to lab-grown diamonds?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. **Dimensional Ratios and Aesthetic Appeal**\n",
    "   - Analyze how **dimensional ratios** (e.g., length-to-width, depth-to-width) correlate with price and whether these ratios align with industry standards for aesthetic appeal.\n",
    "   - Example: Do diamonds with a depth-to-width ratio within a specific range fetch higher prices?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 13. **Impact of Certification on Price**\n",
    "   - Investigate whether the **certification type** (e.g., GIA vs. GIA Lab-Grown) has a significant impact on price, controlling for other factors like cut, color, and clarity.\n",
    "   - Example: Are GIA-certified diamonds priced higher than GIA Lab-Grown diamonds with similar attributes?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 14. **Outlier Analysis**\n",
    "   - Identify outliers in the dataset (e.g., diamonds with unusually high prices for their attributes) and investigate what makes them unique. This can help uncover hidden factors that influence pricing.\n",
    "   - Example: Are there diamonds with \"Good\" cut and \"H\" color that are priced higher than expected due to other factors like fluorescence or proportions?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 15. **Customer Preferences by Attribute**\n",
    "   - Use clustering techniques to group diamonds based on attributes like **cut, color, clarity, carat weight, and price**. This can help identify customer preferences and market segments.\n",
    "   - Example: Are there distinct customer segments that prioritize carat weight over clarity, or vice versa?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 16. **Seasonal Trends in Pricing**\n",
    "   - If the dataset includes timestamps (e.g., sales data), analyze whether there are seasonal trends in diamond pricing. For example, prices may be higher during wedding seasons or holidays.\n",
    "   - Example: Do prices for GIA Lab-Grown diamonds fluctuate more than natural diamonds during peak seasons?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 17. **Interaction Between Attributes**\n",
    "   - Investigate complex interactions between attributes. For example, does the combination of **cut, color, and clarity** have a multiplicative effect on price rather than an additive one?\n",
    "   - Example: Is the price premium for \"Excellent\" cut diamonds higher when paired with \"D\" color and \"IF\" clarity compared to other combinations?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 18. **Sustainability and Ethical Considerations**\n",
    "   - If additional data is available, explore whether diamonds marketed as sustainable or ethically sourced (e.g., lab-grown) have different pricing trends compared to traditional diamonds.\n",
    "   - Example: Are customers willing to pay a premium for lab-grown diamonds with high clarity and color grades?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Price Hierarchy:\n",
    "- Marquise and Heart shapes command the highest average prices\n",
    "- Princess cuts have the lowest average prices\n",
    "- There's a significant price gap between the top-tier shapes (Marquise, Heart) and bottom-tier shapes (Princess, Radiant)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Dimensional Characteristics:\n",
    "- Marquise diamonds have the highest length-to-width ratio (1.97), which is expected given their elongated shape\n",
    "- Princess cuts have the highest depth percentage (72.32%) and table percentage (70.36%)\n",
    "- Square shapes (Princess, Cushion) maintain a length-to-width ratio close to 1.0\n",
    "- Oval and Pear shapes show consistent length-to-width ratios of 1.43 and 1.59 respectively\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Volume vs Price Relationship:\n",
    "- Heart shapes show the highest average volume (292.42 cubic units)\n",
    "- Emerald cuts have the lowest average volume (101.58 cubic units)\n",
    "- Despite having lower volumes, some shapes (like Marquise) command higher prices, suggesting that shape preference often outweighs raw volume in pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Proportional Trends:\n",
    "- Round diamonds show the most consistent depth-to-price relationship\n",
    "- Fancy shapes (Marquise, Pear, Oval) show more variation in their proportions\n",
    "- Table percentages vary significantly by shape, with Princess cuts having the widest tables (70.36%) and Round cuts having the narrowest (57.81%)\n",

    "Key Insights:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Statistical Significance:\n",
    "- The ANOVA test shows a statistically significant difference in prices across fluorescence levels (p-value = 0.0175, which is < 0.05)\n",
    "- This confirms that fluorescence does have a meaningful impact on diamond prices\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Price Impact:\n",
    "- Diamonds with Faint fluorescence command the highest prices (average $5,029.49)\n",
    "- Medium fluorescence diamonds show a 10.25% price reduction compared to Faint\n",
    "- Strong fluorescence diamonds show the largest discount at 12.85% below Faint\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Distribution Patterns:\n",
    "- Faint fluorescence is most common, representing about 56.92% of GIA diamonds\n",
    "- Medium fluorescence accounts for 25.47% of diamonds\n",
    "- Strong fluorescence is least common at 17.61%\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Market Implications:\n",
    "- There's a clear inverse relationship between fluorescence strength and price\n",
    "- The price penalty for fluorescence is progressive, with stronger fluorescence resulting in larger price discounts\n",
    "- The market appears to value diamonds with less fluorescence, likely due to their perceived higher quality\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Value Proposition:\n",
    "- The significant price differences between fluorescence levels could represent opportunities for value-conscious buyers\n",
    "- Strong fluorescence diamonds, while less expensive, might offer good value for buyers who are less concerned about this characteristic\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings suggest that fluorescence is an important factor in diamond pricing, with lower fluorescence generally commanding premium prices. This information could be valuable for both buyers making purchase decisions and sellers setting pricing strategies.\n",
